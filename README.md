Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion, most typically from facial expressions as well as from verbal expressions. This is both something that humans do automatically but computational methodologies have also been developed.

Human expression recognition plays an important role in the interpersonal relationship. â€¦ Expression are reflected from speech, hand and gestures of the body and through facial expressions. Hence extracting and understanding of expression has a high importance of the interaction between human and machine communication.

we will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions.
